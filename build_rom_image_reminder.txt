- Assemble to source:
dasm 6502.asm -l6502.list

- Use text editor to copy/manipulate listing to get sequential list of bytes (1 per line).
  - Copy addresses starting from $8000. Do not include IRQ or Reset vectors.
  - Name it "hex.txt".

- Prepare microcontroller code:
python hex.py

- Copy writes into EEPROM burner Arduino code (https://github.com/nickbild/eeprom_burner).
  - Make sure to set program start address (in $FFFC-$FFFD) and, if needed, IRQ (in $FFFE-$FFFF).
    - These addresses are found at the end of the listing.
